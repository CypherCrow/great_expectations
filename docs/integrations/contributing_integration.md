title: How To Write Integration (With Great Expectations) Documentation
---

### Introduction
As the data stack ecosystem grows and expands in usage and tooling, so does the need to integrate with 3rd party
products or services. [Superconductive](https://superconductive.com) as drivers and ushers
of [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io), we want to make the process to integrating with Great Expectations
as low friction as possible. We are committed to work and iterate in the process and greatly value any feedback you may have.
The aim of this document is to provide guidance for vendors or community partners which wish to integrate with us as to
how to write documentation for said integration and to establish a sense of uniformity and consistency.

:::tip
Good fences make good neighbors. It's important to make clear to would-be users of the integration who created the
integration and who to turn to if they need help. While we don't have any prescriptive solution, directing users
to a Slack channel or github repo you monitor is a generally accepted open source community standard.
